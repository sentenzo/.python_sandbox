A bit of `asyncio` tinkering, inspired by [Python Asyncio: The Complete Guide](https://superfastpython.com/python-asyncio/).

0. `async_to_sync.py` — making a sync function out of the async one;
1. `sync_to_async.py` — how to efficiently turn blocking calls into coroutines;
2. `sync_to_async_conflict.py` — shared resourcies conflict — a possible pitfall of the prev. approach;
